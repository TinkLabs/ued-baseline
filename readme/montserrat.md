### Main font : Montserrat
Our primary typeface is Montserrat. All weights and versions are available in this family. Montserrat is perfect for a wide range of visual communications. Itâ€™s versatile for display and text. It also reads well on mobile devices and the Web.
### Usage
You don't need to use these classes since the 6 preset typography would suffice, unless there are external contents that need to be overrided
