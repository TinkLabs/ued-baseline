<h3>Main font : Merriweather Sans</h3>
<p>Our secondary typeface is Merriweather Sans. It can be used in more formal communications. It should be used in conjunction with our primary typeface to add variety to our designs or to break up large blocks of text.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>You don't need to use these classes since the 6 preset typography would suffice, unless there are external contents that need to be overrided</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p class="merriweather-sans-extraBold"&gt; text &lt;p&gt; </code></pre>
