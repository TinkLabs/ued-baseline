### Main Fonts

`Montserrat` and `Merriweather Sans` are the 2 main fonts used,
with full support on `font-weight` and `font-style`.

Most of the time you will only need to use pre-defined typography. See typography tag for more information.

File types `woff2` `woff` `ttf` are available.

#### Usage
Use with class name: [family]-[weight]-[style]

```html
<span class="montserrat-extraLight-italic"> text </span>
```

Or in CSS:

```css
.my-div {
    font-family: Montserrat;
    font-size: 14px;
    font-weight: 600;
    font-style: italic;
}
```
