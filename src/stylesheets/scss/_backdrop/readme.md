### Backdrop
A backdrop appears behind all other surfaces in an app, displaying contextual and actionable content.

### Usage
Style both layer so user can distinguish them.
Use class `collapse` on `bd-front` to toggle front layer position.

```html
<div class="backdrop">
    <div class="bd-back bg-white">
        Back
    </div>
    <div class="bd-front bg-navy-200">
        Front
    </div>
</div>
```
